            <font size="10px">Hello</font>, My name is Rendell James Moreno but most of my friends call me “Del”. I am a 20-year-old Computer Science student in
            Malayan Colleges Mindanao and an aspiring computer programmer.
            My hobby is to play online games and you could see me playing on my own. I prefer to enjoy my company on my own rather
            than being surrounded by so many people but are fake. I don’t like dishonest person and that’s why trust for me is hard
            to acquire. I also do have a job where I can earn money and spend out of it what I want.
            I spent my spare time in browsing to social media looking into what’s popular and you could see me laughing to those
            funny posts. I love watching movies especially action movies and anime. I also love to spend my time with my friends, we
            get along together, talking and doing the same thing we do. I have a lot of memories with them.
            My goals are first of all, finish my school, graduate and after that is to have a stable job which is being a computer
            programmer, travel in the places I want to go and spend my life memorable and make the most out of it.
        </p>

        <p>
            When I reach the age of 30 years old, I want to be in a job with a healthy environment wherein I can still continue to develop my skills in computer programming, financially stable and still be connected with my friends from highschool and college.
