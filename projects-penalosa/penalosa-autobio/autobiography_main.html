                <b> Hey there! I'm Gerome,</b>
            </span> <br> <br>

            I am currently a second-year Computer Science student at Malayan Colleges Mindanao that aspires to be a good application developer as well as a web developer. It’s funny because Computer Science was not my first course of choice. My very first aspiration was to be a Pilot starting from kindergarten until 9th grade. When I reached 10th grade, I decided to become a Computer Engineer in the future which made me enroll in TVL-ICT at Malayan Colleges Mindanao for my Senior High School. When I was studying for 2 years in Senior High School, it crossed my mind that I don’t want to be a Computer Engineer anymore but instead, I want to be a Graphic Designer or Video Editor. But I realized after graduating Senior High School that I really want to be in a computer-related field instead of multimedia. Here I am now, studying computer science and so far, I did not regret my decision. Maybe a bit hihu. Well, I did not select MMA as my course because I think that I can learn for myself about designing and other stuffs. I mostly use warm colors in my designs or white and other shades of blue even in my clothing. In my spare time, I take Video Editing commissions and other graphic stuffs so that I can earn money and save up for myself. Also, I really love playing games may it be on PC or mobile.

            By the time I reach 30 years old, I want to be a businessman/programmer with good investments and properties. I also want to be able to purchase my own car and help my brother in his studies. I also aim to have more investments by the time I become 30 years old so that by the time I reach the age of 50 or 40, my investments will pay off.
